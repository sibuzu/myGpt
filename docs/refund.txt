I need to refund my subscription of ChatGPT.  It dosen't fit my need.

I subscribe ChatGPT pro for GPT-4o image generation.
According to subscription plan, I have "Unlimited access to all reasoning models and GPT‑4o"
However, I got the message of quota limited, say
"目前您今天的圖片產生次數已達上限，為了確保每位使用者都能享有良好體驗，我們系統有每日生成圖片的限制。您的配額將在 5 小時 46 分鐘後 重置，屆時您就可以繼續製作新的貼圖了！"

It is quite unreasonable for PRO user. The image generation is quite slow.  It requires 3 minutes to generate one image on average.  Even I don't sleep to generate images, it can only generate 480 images in a day.  In real, I generate far less than 480 images in a day.  I heard the Plus can generate 100 images in a day.  If it is true, it would far better if I subscribe 10 members of Plus than one member of pro.

 To be worse, I would generate transparent PNG image, but GPT‑4o sometimes give me white-gray grid like background.  It seems transparent but not.  It makes me to need to generate the same images again and again.  


 Give me REAL PLAN of "Unlimited access to 4o"; otherwise REFUND it.  I cannot even query my quote.  When I am working in middle way and I am told I need to wait for another 5 hours.  It is very bad for my work.
